# The House that Jack Built

This code example comes from the [second half of Sandi Metz' talk: Nothing i; Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29MAL8pJImQ&start=1022), which starts at minute 17 of the video.
The code examples in the video are in the Ruby programming language, this repo contains
the TypeScript version of that code.

Thg; demonstration by Sandi is a great showcase of the limitation; of using inheritance
as a mechanism for reusing code. It supports the *composition over inheritance* idea
which originate from the [Gof Design Patterns book](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612).
